Forensic Nanopore STR sequencing

## Background

DNA analysis has become the cornerstone of contemporary forensic science. Altough most forensic DNA testing still use PCR and capillary 
electrophoresis (CE)-based analysis methods, a transition to sequencing techniques is at hand.
Next generation targetted sequencing allows forensic scientists worldwide to harness the full potential of their DNA sample. 

## Aim

The aim of the paper ("Forensic STR profiling using Oxford Nanopore Technologie's MinION sequencer) associating this repository was to asses the capability of Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ (ONT) handheld sequencer MinION™ to created a forensic SNP based profile. 

## Motivation

The cloud based base calling software Metrichor being used by ONT offers a fully integrated, bespoke, real-time analysis solution. However, as ONT sequencing was primarerly designed to analyze long reads (>1kb) the base calling software lacks the capability to analyze short (<100bp) sequences. 
To bypass this hiatus, the short PCR amplicons were be pooled and ligated randomly to artifically create longer sequencable fragments.
This repository contains the code to identify, split and allocate the concatenated reads into to subreads and the subsequent SNP detection.
